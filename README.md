# local_dynamics_simulator
A simulator for the time evolution of scalar field disformally / conformally coupled to matter. Compares the local dynamics with the global (cosmological) evolution.

### Dependencies
- pipenv (with python>=3.6)

### Quick instruction (full version of readme.md preparation in progress):
```$ ./install``` and then
```$./run```
(do $ chmod +x if needed)

If the automatic run does not work:
```$ bokeh serve --show simulation.py```
(opens the simulator in your web browser)
